The goal of the envirotox R data package is to make datasets from the
[Envirotox database](http://www.envirotoxdatabase.org/) available for
testing species sensitivity distribution code.

The datasets should not be used to make any conclusions about the
toxicity of the chemicals in the database.

Each dataset consists of alternative workups of the data in Envirotox.
